#### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [Recommended](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/recommended-371/)

❛❛***Currently, we have little choice when we need to embed a Lottie animation into a WordPress website built with the block editor. Luckily, this plugin is far above average and offers many options to finetune your animation.***

***(Tip: You can even use it to embed a Lottie animation with the Divi builder – simply create a sidebar, insert the animation there, and then bring it into your page using Divi’s sidebar module.)***❜❜
